# Automated Detection of Pneumonia
## Introduction:
The goal of our project is to build a neural network model to accurately predict whether a person's chest-x-ray image is affected by pneumonia or not.
## Process:
After importing the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) we have done EDA and Data preparation, then we set a baseline by building a logistic regression model. After that, we constructed a CNN model. We need to tune or model to get a better accuracy score. Also, using a CNN with a transfer base to improve our results.
